* menu bar on home page is not sticky until a click has been made!!!!
* album icon is ambiguous
* show map of countries visited
* fix videos (which means support videos!), or else remove them
* don't show photos loading on album
* don't show main photo loading
* don't show photos loading on album catalog
* the drop shadow is _just_ visible when the headers scroll away, which means the top of the picture is never 100% clear
