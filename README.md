*Backlog*

* mouse moves over photos should reveal controls
* escape key should take from photo to album
* escape key should take from album to album catalog
* menu bar on home page is not sticky until a click has been made!!!!
* album icon is ambiguous
* show map of countries visited
* fix videos (which means support videos!), or else remove them
* don't show photos loading on album
* don't show main photo loading
* don't show photos loading on album catalog
* the drop shadow is _just_ visible when the headers scroll away, which means the top of the picture is never 100% clear
* send message to web master
* show map of dive destinations
* better accessibility for phones (e.g., controls at bottom/center? swipe for next photo?)

*Icebox*
* go to next/prev album from within album
* when returning to the album, make sure to show the last photo looked at
