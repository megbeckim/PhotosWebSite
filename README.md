Provide the password for the FTP account, which is the usual password since the UK.

*Backlog*

* fix portrait/fullscreen on mobile not to have too big a font!
* fix videos (which means support videos!), or else remove them
* when returning to the album, make sure to show the last photo looked at
* the drop shadow is _just_ visible when the headers scroll away, which means the top of the picture is never 100% clear
* send message to web master
* show map of dive destinations
* better accessibility for phones (e.g., controls at bottom/center? swipe for next photo?)

*UX improvements*

* style map better: better colors, better legend, better hover-overs, better responsiveness, zooming in for caribbean
* full-screen from places other than home page?
* album icon is ambiguous: perhaps a consistent back-button would be better
* don't show photos loading on album
* don't show main photo loading
* don't show photos loading on album catalog
* hiding prev/next on touch devices (e.g., phones)


*Icebox*

* go to next/prev album from within album
